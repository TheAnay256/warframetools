# Warframe Tools

## Warframe Loot Search

Warframe is a very complicated game with a vast amount of items and places to find them. The game's wiki, while generally good, isn't great at showing a unified list of the places an item can be procured.

Sadly no real API is published with item loot chances and locations, but an HTML page containing loot locations is autogenerated: https://n8k6e2y6.ssl.hwcdn.net/repos/hnfvc0o3jnfvc873njb03enrf56.html

The loot search app parses a saved copy of that HTML page for data, and makes it searchable.

### Files of note:
 * App.js is the backbone of the app, handles data and eventually routing
 * utils.js reads and parses the HTMl data on the page into a readable format
 * LootSearch.js is an implementation of react-autosuggest, and enables quick searching through large amounts of items
 * MissionRewards.js displays the chances of an item to be dropped during a normal mission
 * resources/warframeDrops.html is the saved copy of the page; our data source
 
To run the app, clone -> npm install -> npm run dev. It's viewable on localhost:8080. Try searching for "Cryo Rounds"!

### Things still to come
 * More visually appealing styling
 * Show all categories of item locations
 * Features beyond loot search, such as event timers and blueprint lookup
